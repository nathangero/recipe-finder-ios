# Recipe Finder

## Description

This app shows users desserts from the [Free Meal API](https://themealdb.com/api.php) in alphabetical order. Users can also see the full recipe for a dessert, and they'll see the full ingredients and measurements, step-by-step instructions, and the photo and title of the dessert they're looking at.

This was written in full SwiftUI and using XCode 15.
